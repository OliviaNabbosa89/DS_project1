## **Installations**
The code will run smoothly with python 3.
If not yet installed, install ipynb to use the customarized functions in the notebooks.
 ```
 pip install ipynb
 ```
## **Project motivation**
In this project, I use the Seattle listings and calendar data to answer the following business questions:

1. How do the number of listings and prices vary in the Seattle's neighbourhoods?
2. Do the room or property types change the price?
3. Are there extra fees and how do they vary?
4. How do the listing prices vary during the calendar?
5. How well do the features in the listings data set explain the variation prices in Seattle?

## **File Descriptions**
There are 5 notebooks to answer the questions above. 
* Listings_EDA        - Answers questions 1-3.
* Calendar_analysis   - Answers question 4.
* Predicting_prices   - Answers question 5.
* my_functions        - Customerized functions which are used in the analysis in the Listings_EDA and Calendar_analysis notebooks.

I include markdown cells to define the goal, steps of the code and present summary of the results.
There are in-line comments to further describe some steps in the code.
