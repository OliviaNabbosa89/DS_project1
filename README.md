## **Project motivation**
In this project, I use the Seattle listings and calendar data to answer the following questions:

1. How many listings are registered in the different neighbourhoods?
2. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary in the different neighbourhoods?
3. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary for the different property types?
4. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary for the different room types?
5. How do the prices vary in the year (months and prices)
6. How do the prices vary in the month (Days of the week and prices)
7. How well do the selected features from the Seattle listings data predict the prices in Seattle?
