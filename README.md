 In this project, I analyse the listings and calendar from the Seattle Airbnb open data 2016 and answer questions related to the price variations and drivers.

## **Installations**
The code will run smoothly with python 3.
If not yet installed, install ipynb to use the customarized functions in the notebooks.
 ```
 pip install ipynb
 ```
## **Project motivation**
In this project, I use the Seattle listings and calendar data to answer the following questions:

1. How many listings are registered in the different neighbourhoods?
2. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary in the different neighbourhoods?
3. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary for the different property types?
4. How and by how much the prices and cleaning fees vary for the different room types?
5. How do the prices vary in the year (months and prices)
6. How do the prices vary in the month (Days of the week and prices)
7. How well do the selected features from the Seattle listings data predict the prices in Seattle?

## **File Descriptions**
There are 5 notebooks to answer the questions above. 
* Data Preprocessings - Imputating missing values and removing outliers.
* Listings_EDA        - Answers questions 1-4.
* Calendar_analysis   - Answers questions 5 & 6.
* Predicting_prices   - Answers question 7.
* my_functions        - Customerized functions.

I include markdown cells to define the goal, steps of the code and present summary of the results.
There are in-line comments to further describe some steps in the code.
